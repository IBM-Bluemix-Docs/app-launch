You can create an engagement using In-App Messaging. 

Through this engagement an app owner can send notifications to the app users while they are actively using the application.

Messages can be targeted to all application users or to a specific set of users and devices. For every message that you submit to the service, the intended audience receives a notification.

In-app messages can be scheduled by defining a start/end date and time. You may also schedule it based on an event.

These messages are more cutomized as they are based on analytics insights about the user's choice, user's interactions, device, application logs etc.

In-app messages can be used to:

- Send customized messages
- Send messages to users who have turned off push notifications
- Request a feedback or engage users in a conversation
- Send relevant messages after knowing what the user is looking for
- Engage active and loyal customers
- Inform users on the app updates or launch of a new feature
and so on.
