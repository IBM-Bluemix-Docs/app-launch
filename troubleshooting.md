You can get help by searching for information or by asking questions through a forum. You can also open a support ticket. When you are using the forums to ask a question, tag your question so that it is seen by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} development teams.

  * You can check whether {{site.data.keyword.engage_short}} is available by going to the [IBM Cloud status page](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/support/#status){:new_window}.
  * If you have technical questions about App Launch, post your question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-cloud-applaunch) and tag your question with "ibm-cloud-applaunch".
  * For questions about the service and getting started instructions, use the [IBM developerWorks](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/bluemix-mobile-services/) forum. Include the `applaunch` tag.
