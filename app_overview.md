The App Launch service removes the tight coupling between App publishing and multiple feature roll-outs. You can now incorporate features without exposing it to the app publishing. With the App Launch service, app owners can choose to define the timing and roll-outs of features, across the various audience segments.

The App Launch service lets you define a feature, create audiences based on device platforms, create custom audience attributes, and finally define an engagement that choreographs the timing and placement of the feature. Once you have used the SDKs along with the feature and metrics attributes that are incorporated in the application, the service starts measuring audience experiences. You can now leverage your app based on this information to create customized customer engagements across various categories of your app users. 

The salient features of the App Launch services are:

	
* App user insights based on app usage

	The service offers developers different insights perspectives on the collected app user data. 

* Create variants of an engagement

	Developers can define an engagement and experiment it across various audience segments using different variants of the engagement. This helps app owners understand the reach and acceptance of an engagement.

* Creating targeted audience groups

	App owners can create audience groups based on various criteria and target various features within an app. This will help you define various groups across your audience, or even reach out to cross sections of an audience within a larger group.
