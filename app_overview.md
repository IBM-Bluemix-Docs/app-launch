# About App Launch

The App Launch service lets developers build engaging apps by controlling reach and roll out of App features while measuring the defined metrics. The service helps developers to remove the coupling that exists today between App feature rollout and App updates to production. You can now publish features without exposing it to Production. This enables the developers to gradually release new versions of an app in a controlled manner. With the App Launch service, app owners have full control over feature rollout for a targeted segment.

The App Launch service lets you define a feature, create audiences based on device platforms, create custom audience attributes, and finally define an engagement that choreographs the timing and placement of the feature. Once you have used the SDKs along with the feature and metrics attributes that are incorporated in the application, the service starts measuring audience experiences. You can now leverage your app based on this information to create customized customer engagements across various categories of your app users. 

The salient features of the App Launch services are:

* Accelerate feature deployment

    Accelerate delivery of features to your app through controlled release by mitigating risks. Release features to subset of audience segments and make larger rollout or roll back decisions based on real time feedback. Separate feature rollouts from regular release cycles.

* Segment Audience

    User segments can be defined based on demographic, contextual and behavioral attributes. Alternatively features can be rolled out to certain percentage of the entire user base. Key Performance indicators can be defined for each feature and client side code instrumented to measure the results.

* Adapt application based on context

    Application behavior, user interface, notifications can be customized for specific audience segments. For example, app background can be changed based on user location. This user personalization results in higher engagement of users with the application.

* A / B test features

    Gain confidence by experimentation. Two variants of application features can be compared against each other by rolling out both at the same time. Decisions can be made based on hard data.
	
* Increase Customer Engagement

    Promote user engagement. Notifications can be targeted to all application users or to a specific set of users and devices. A message schedule can be defined. User interaction plays a vital role in customer relationships.
