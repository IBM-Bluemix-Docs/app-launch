You can create an engagement using Feature Control. 

Through this engagement an app owner can control the visibility of a feature by enabling or disabling it during runtime.

A feature can be enabled/disabled to all the application users or to a specific set of users and devices. 

Feature roll outs can be scheduled and co-ordinated by defining a start/end time and date. You can also choose a specific day on which a defined feature should be enabled/disabled.

**Enabling Feature Control Capability**

Ensure that you have gone through and have the necessary [prerequisites](/docs/services/app-launch/app_prerequisites.html) in place.
